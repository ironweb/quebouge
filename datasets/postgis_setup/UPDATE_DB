To update the database do the following steps:

Go in PGADMIN3, and drop WITH CASCADE the three following tables:

 - activities
 - categories
 - occurences

Then, go in your virtual environment, and run:

  populate_Yellow my_development.ini

If you don't find those scripts, make sure you have run:

  python setup.py develop

before.  This will take the 'entry_points' in the setup.py and write the
scripts in the env/bin/ directory.
